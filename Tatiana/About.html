<?php $title = "About Teacher Tools"; include 'header.php';?>

	<p>This tool is our project for a Computer Science class.<br>We created a LCMS that will allow any educators to create courses of any subject.</p>
	<p>If you want to teach a cooking class, you can do it here.<br>If you want to teach a chemistry class, that would be easy too!</p>
	<p>You can upload files, create tests and labs, assign homework and keep track of all scores.</p>
